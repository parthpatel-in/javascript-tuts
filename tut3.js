//What are Primitive and Reference Types in JavaScript? 
//Primitive types:-
/*
Primitive data types are numbers, Booleans, strings, undefined, null, and symbol. Primitive data types are the basic or common data types in JavaScript. Following is the table of primitive data types in JavaScript. 

Primitive Data Type

Meaning

var x;

undefined

var x=undefined;

undefined

var x=null;

null type data

var x=3;

number.

var x=6.5

number

var x="5"

string

var x='5'

string

var x="Hello World"

string

var x=true

Boolean

var x=false;

Boolean

Here is an example:*/

let number = 20
// the number variable stores a number value i.e. 20. Number values are called "primitive values" because they are simple building blocks of JavaScript apps.

let name = 'Harry' 
let isMale = true 
// String and Booleans are also primitive types so we can also declare variables using var and const.

/*

Reference Types
Reference in JavaScript are datatypes based on primitive. Like Objects, Arrays, and Functions. Everything is JavaScript is either an Object or Primitive datatype. When we create an object, that value is not directly assigned to the variable. Instead, a reference to that value is what gets set. Variable knows about the location of the object in memory, not the object itself. Following is the table of the reference data type.

*/

// Reference Data Type

// Meaning

var y=[ "March", "April", "May" ]

// Array

var y={ name : "Harry",

age : 22,

gender : "male" }

// Object

var y=function(){ }

// Function on

var y=new Date();

// Date

// Hereâ€™s an example:-

var student = {
  name: 'Harry',
  age: 20,
} 
//object
var sports= ['Tennis', 'Cricket']//array
/*
Here, a student is an object and, therefore, a so-called reference type. The student object holds properties that have primitive values. This does not affect the object being a reference type, though. 

The sports array is also a reference type - in this case, it holds a list of strings. A string is a primitive datatype, but it does not affect the array. Arrays are reference types.
*/

// What is the difference between primitive and reference datatype?
/*
JavaScript stores the primitive value on the stack because the size of a primitive value is fixed. On the other hand, JavaScript stores the reference value on the heap because the size of the reference value is dynamic.
One of the most significant differences between primitive data and reference data is that, If the value is primitive, then we manipulate the actual valuestored in that variable. Whereas, If the value is of reference data type, we can manipulate that object's reference, rather than the actual object. It means a variable that stores an object is accessed by reference.*/
